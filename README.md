## Coding Assignment 1 (Linear Regression)
- implementing the closed-form solution to linear regression and it will use matrix-vector representations for data representation and get some experience with data visualization. In addition, it will explore the phenomenon of “regression to the mean.” 

- generating data with 2 steps
    - Independently generate α ~ N(0,σ_a^2) and b ~ N(0,σ_b^2)
    - Rotate (a, b)^T to a degree (eg 45°) and obtain (x,y)^T
- In the function leastSquares(X, Y), X is simply the input and Y is simply the output. It is not related to x2y regression or y2x regression.
- In second problem, we will explore gradient descent optimization for linear regression, applied to the Boston house price prediction
- Training loss (MSE)
- The measure of success
- hyperparameters
